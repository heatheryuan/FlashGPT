Concepts
media + literacy
All media are texts that can be read for meaning 
Significance: acts to underscore the importance of media education beyond the written word, critical skills for interpretation to understand the meanings of our media consumption 
EX) book, song, video game, movie, etc
media + everyday life
The media source of our pleasure and routines that help give structure to our media consumptions. 
Significance: Gives us different understanding and perspectives about the world, gives a form of connection through media as a topic 
EX) 
utopian, dystopian, & mirror views + critiques cultural studies & methods
Utopian- medium/genre/practice is good or that it used to be bad but it’s getting better
If found objectionable there’s something else for you, acts as informational & educational resource, window to new experiences eye opening, don't deny that it has bad stuff out there, multiplicity of choice and viewpoint 
Critics say: dismisses social harm, thinks there is something out there for everyone, ignore the hierarchies in production, employs the “myth of progress”
EX) facebook 
Dystopian- medium/genre/practice is bad or that it used to be good and turned to be worse
passive & addictive, exploitative & formulaic, consumerist & advertisements| directly harmful to individuals and social ills
Critics say: is it all bad ? totalizing, nostalgic “kids these days”, elitist, for the majority interest, assumes passive consumption
EX) The social network 
Mirror views- medium/genre/practice reflects reality
Media mirror major changes
Critics say: selective process of production, reasons in which audiences watch, different interpretations from audiences
	Cultural studies- media change society + society changes media are linked together
Industry + everyday life + society + politics = interrelated, focus on interpretive approach rather than scientific data collection
Cultural Studies Methods
Textual analysis → essays that evaluate themes and meaning 
Audience studies/reception studies → how does the audience react 
Political economy → media power and economics, how does media shape the economy
technological vs. content convergence implications of content convergence
Convergence- blurring of boundaries between two or more previously separate kinds of media
Technological convergence- a single tech capable of performing the functions of multiple, previously distinct media
EX) ipad, phone
Content convergence- content from one medium now available through a variety of devices
EX) netflix, twitter, apps
Implications of content convergence: Connect fragmented audiences (for industry, media makers, and audience), more outlets and opportunities, encourages time shifting (binging, rewatching), place shifting(mobile consumption), greater content verity (older content) 
transmedia extensions & goals
	Extensions or a form of content convergence, to revise additional content that allows more engaging consumption experience, immersed in a multimedia experience
	Goal: keep audiences engaged,”brand advocates” generate awareness, expose viewers to ads in for motions, collect use your data to understand who and how people interact with media
EX) cast info, behind the scenes, links for soundtrack or social media for show
transmedia storytelling (Mikos)
	form of Transmedia extension of a story throughout different platforms, they share the same textual universe, part of the story itself builds on the story each are designed to stand on its own and contribute to the larger story world
	EX) Star Wars 
unauthorized content convergence
	A type of content convergence, puts their own twist from the basis of the story unauthorized because they are produced outside of the corporation that controls the copyright
Created as an extension to the primary media text to support and promote it
EX) baby yoda memes from the mandalorian made without permission 
ideology & dominant ideology
	Ideology- values and benefits that people use to make sense of the world, guide or we think on how to live and behave, A sense of common sense and natural to individuals that hold them ideology starts at birth and spreads through institutions such as family, education, government, media, etc.
EX) socialism, democracy
	Dominant Ideology- Hall argued that each society has dominant ideology which is those in power shape ideology through institutional control and reinforce the power of the few but is shared by the majority and are able to change over time
EX) the american dream served interest and ignores that there are obstacles that stop people from reaching full success
hegemony & counter-hegemony
	Hegemony- (Antonio Gramsci) process of maintaining power through seeking ideological consensus, agreement rather than force
	Counter-hegemony- Gramsci argued counter hegemonic media provide resistant counter hegemony challenging these interests of the powerful, confronting it and wanting an alternative 
texts as polysemic
Can be interpreted in multiple ways audience can have active participants interpreting a message based on own beliefs and experiences, shared cultural experiences and beliefs lead to some meanings being more widely recognized
encoding vs. decoding (Hall)
Encoding- encoded at level of production, media makers encode the text with preferred meanings which are often hegemonic in that they reflect the dominant ideology
Decoding- decoded at the level of consumption
Donna hegemonic- accepts preferred meaning
Negotiated- partially accepts prefered meaning
Oppositional- rejects the preferred meaning for an alternative one
values of encoding/decoding
All messages contain more than one potential interpretation
Producers can’t close off all decoding
Our experiences and beliefs determine our decoding
Struggle with getting peoples agreement on ideology
criticisms of encoding/decoding
Very few dominant or oppositional readings
Works better for overtly ideological texts
Needs to link decoding back to encoding
Multiple motivations behind production/including
textual approach to genre
	genre= content sharing conventions and codes
Conventions= specific narrative elements (story)
EX) settings, character types, plot lines, ideology
Codes= modes of production external to the narrative (style)
EX) length, visual style, lighting, music, editing, camera work
problematizing the textual approach
	Determining genre is based on a mic of codes and conventions but is based on select differences, so no system for what differentiates and demands a new category
	Some shared categories matter, others don’t and means that genres textually self-evident
discursive approach to genre (Mittell)
	genres determined by cultural discourse (common shared understanding), understanding the genre through common shared understanding rather than through codes and conventions, discourse shaped through how a genre is defined and interpreted and evaluating
GOAL: not only show how genres are evolved but also why
EX) genres based on animation, on address
industrial utility of genre
Organize production
A label to manage consumer interest 
attempts to manufacture success by offering the familiar
Genres must be communicated through promotion such as trailers, posters etc.
Genres a contract between produces an audiences
genre innovation
	problem of generic repetition = risk of board audience, Genres mutate to add differences
Imitation= follow established genre c&cs
Innovation= deviate from genre c&c
EX) once all symptoms were family, that early 1970s took succumb formula to the workplace, 1980s change to friends and family seconds used to use a multi camera set up now film like single camera setup
story characters & audiences
	story characters- are assigned traits that impact the story, protagonist he’s supposed to be identified with the audience
Externally- frequency, screen time, reaction shots, achievement
Internally- voiceover, POV, memory
anthology, episodic, serial
Serial- Open to revision, same characters but different situations, status quo is always developing, accumulation of detail in history
EX) Breaking Bad
Anthology- different characters in different situations each episode self contained, closure brings in new finest status quo, next episode introduces new characters and plots
EX) Black mirror, twilight zone
Episodic- same character, same situation circular closure that return to original status quo OK to miss and mixup episodes
EX) The simpsons
blurred boundaries between TV & film
Programming/consumption scheduling and watching movies on TV
Talent (Film actors and directors making TV shows)
Stories (movies rebooted as TV shows)
Storytelling (films structured like multiple TV episodes)
squeezing vs. stretching (Martin)
	squeezing- Longform content into short form content
EX) novel to movie, emphasizing plot/action, cutting things out 
stretching- short form continent into longform contact
EX) movie to tv
Mediation
Practice of recording selecting and ordering events into media narrative, not reality but a representation of it and a construction shaped through codes and conventions
EX) documentary, photo 
news & how it’s shaped
the result of routines that become formalized interpersonal norms, News is constructed to feel objective and newsworthy
four ways of constructing reality TV (Kraszewski)
Selecting participants
Both over arching in mini narrative structures
Locations
Editing
The Real World utility + narrative (Kraszewski) celebrity
	MTV respond to changes of racial exclusion and promote liberal values well blames race schism on the rule individuals in the construction of reality TV helps construct our beliefs and values
economics of celebrity
hope is to encourage customers to buy into a new product by offering something so familiar and appealing such as a celebrity, it is able to increase service ability and promote their products using the celebrity market ability using something other than the original media to generate money
star text & its four components
Body of work: albums, rolls, etc.
Promotion: authorized and calculated image construction
Publicity: generated by the press etc. outside of direct control
Audience Practices: include the general public, fans and anti-fans
relevant fantasy (Fiske)
	???
authenticity & symbolic resources (Sobande) character types vs. stereotypes
Celebrities can provide symbolic resources that reinforce dominant norms or challenge them and that they can face disciplining public ridicule for doing so, celebrities embrace their marginalized identity to communicate authenticity
EX) viola Davis‘s performance of blackness, natural Ness and femininity 
Character types- or a shorthand to keep media makers communicate quickly meaning, inner textual constructions with commonly understood traits and behaviors
EX) protagonist, antagonist
Stereotypes- reduce an entire group into a few simple characteristics that emerge from inequalities of representational power and spread intertextuality through repeated media representations
EX) all blondes are dumb or that jocks are dumb
power & representation (Croteau & Hoynes) the Other & how media spread it
portrayal of difference- inclusion
Roles
Control, having the power to construct media and represent who wants to be represented
“splitting” (Hall)
	fix boundaries between social groups to collectively reinforce power inequalities
Believes that there are us versus them one normal and one outsider
multicultural representation
	portrayal of cultural differences within groups creating multiplicity of characters realities in contacts goes into more characters rather than one single representation
four media sales logics
	???
three hybrid sales logics
Combination- multiple simultaneous logics
EX) some streaming services turn style plus ad-supported, some video games commodities plus micro transactions
Economies of scope- selling a product across multiple revenue windows and logics
EX) movie theatrical window
Premium option- charging additional fees for a premium version with additional perks
EX) add free Spotify, YouTube premium, Hulu premium
maximizing profit vs. market share maximizing investment capital vs. sunk cost the culture industry
	maximizing profit- goal is to increase revenue economies of scope, overproduction, international markets, minimize expenses, economic of scale the cost of making a product decreases with the number of the units sold
Market share- The percent of the market held by a specific company and trucks whole company does compared to other competitors
Maximizing Investment capital- The more money and invest in and promote the project the greater likelihood of success but can also lead to the sunk cost fallacy
Sunk cost- profit does not come above the amount put into it
mass culture
	industrialized media produced by the culture industry not from the masses but for the masses and is manufactured for consumers by and for the cultural and financial benefits of the bourgeoisie turns audiences into objects
impact of mass culture
	conformity, mindless stimulation, artist Fishel concerns, leisure time becomes commodified, no sense of community and collectivity
false consciousness
	miss lead people into thinking that the route to contentment comes from consumption rather than upward mobility, presents accumulating consumer goods as an expression of identity and free choice but rather is a fantasy of control really creating inexhaustible dissatisfaction and D skills, do you politicize his, desensitizes, isolates over words masses
mass media industrialization
	media is manufactured like other industrialized  commodities
Standardization- Assembly line production
Social cement- psychic adjustment to the needs of capitalism makes us emotionally obedient
Pseudo-individualization- same product hidden by a veneer of difference
criticisms of the Frankfurt School
	elitist defense of high culture, sweeping generalizations, greater media choice today, lacks failure, lacks innovation, and lacks actual audience interpretation
Fisk says the school makes assumptions about media rather than exploring how media is made at the site of conception term methods like audience interviews, observation, or surveys
structuring social relations (Fiske) embarrassment & quality (Fiske)
	social norms that guide individual social relationships
Embarrassment occurs when social norms are disrupted and argues that embarrassment extends to what he calls illegitimate pleasures, overcoming embarrassment can challenge culture and change
popular culture
	A process, not a thing or category, a form of mass culture resources concerned with meaning a consumption not producers intentions, making process turn media culture into pop-culture
Examining how people using understand media: interpretation, pleasure, sociality, contestation
excorporation vs. incorporation (Fiske)
	Excorporation- pop-culture scans media culture for resources a can appropriate
Incorporation- media culture scans pop culture for taste/interest it commodify
pop culture & immediacy
	critics come plain pop culture is throwaway not like the works of high culture and it’s tied to the immediate social conditions and represents immediate values and concerns
criticisms of pop culture analysis
	populist celebration, validates dominant commercial interests, pop-culture spreads harmful ideas, audiences can be active but that doesn’t mean they’re powerful
