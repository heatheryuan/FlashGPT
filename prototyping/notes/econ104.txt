Pure Strategy
Nash equilibrium := everyone’s action a* is the best response to all other actions a-
Find best response function by differentiating utility function with respect to action
Pareto efficient := can’t make anyone strictly better off without making someone else worse off
production model: price P(Q) = a - bQ (function of quantity produced)
Cournot := firms choose output
Bertrand := firms choose price
for continuous actions where one player must “just undercut” another, there is no pure strategy
evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) := set of a* where either u(a*, a*) strict dominates u(a*, a) or u(a*, a) strictly dominates u(a, a)
Maxminimizer ⇔ NE
Can show NE by casework
Mixed Strategy
Defined as utility of each action times chance
Given set of outcomes X, a lottery \pi is a set of outcomes over X
Want to understand preferences over \Delta x, set of lotteries
Compound lottery is over \pi, \roh in \Delta x
A preference over \Delta x is independent if \pi >= \sigma iff \alpha \pi + (1-\alpha) \roh >= \alpha \sigma + (1-\alpha) \roh; can be violated by intuitions of risk aversions
Preferences can be continuous if they don’t change suddenly
Continuous + independent => expected utility function
Completely mixed := everything possible
BR is defined analogous
If a player randomizes between actions, she is indifferent between them
Action in mixed strictly dominates if it is better wrt every set of opponent actions
rationalizable action a_i means must exist Z_j for each player j where each player has positive probability of actions in Z_j and it is best response
Trembling hand perfect equilibrium: exists sequence of completely mixed strategies 
Extensive Games
finite extensive game companies histories h = (a^k), P player function so P(h) take an action after h, u_i(o) is utility is game ends there
A strategy assigns action to each history with each h where P(h) = i
Strategy profile is a collection of strategies for each person
choose optimally in every history in which they have to play
subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the extensive game with perfect information Γ is a strategy profile s ? for which for any nonterminal history,strategy profile is NE
One deviation property - cant profit from deviating at any step
Every finite extensive game with perfect information Γ has a subgame perfect equilibrium; backwards induction
Extensive Games, Imperfect
Information partition I has {h, h’} then player only gets access to the set
Simultaneous moves can be modeled as information set
Pure strategy - s maps history to action
Mixed strategy - probability over strategies
Behavioral strategy -  Randomize over informations sets
For any mixed strategy of a player in a finite extensive game with perfect recall there is an outcome-equivalent behavioral strategy.
Nash equilibrium among behavioral strategies

An assessment in the game Γ is a pair (β, µ), where β is a profile of behavioral strategies, and µ is a function that assigns to every information set a probability measure on the set of histories in that set.
Consistent := is there is ever smaller trembling assessments that doe converge to it
An assessment (β, µ) is a sequential equilibrium of the game Γ if it is sequentially rational and consistent.
Idea: let values denote the actual probabilities as well as beliefs over information sets
Then calculate expected utilities and actions subsequent
Bayes rule – update conditionally

Delta 1 delta 2
Let gamma_a denote chance of action a
Assume some \mu which is belief at time of acting and test different values
For sequences, whenever you need something to converge to 0 just use epsilon^k; use this for strategies
Not being able to compute via bayes rule is fine – just means you have to show consistent
Vary the squaring on the tremble
