Notes
Systems
A set is dense in some system if one can always find a number between any other two numbers
sup/inf is the lowest/highest possible upper/lower bound on all elements
bounded: exists A so that all a, |a| < A
complete field := every subset has a LUB and GLB
monotone: only one direction, cauchy: distance between values decreases
bounded + monotone -> converges
Bolzano–Weierstrass: every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence
lim sup(/inf): lim_{n -> \infty} sup(/inf)(a_{m > n})

metric space: some measure d(x,y) => R, with
1) (positivity) positive
2) self distance 0
3) (symmetric) can reverse
4) triangle inequality

topology
cover = family of open sets that contains all points, sets can be infinite
open := ball of points around every point
proper subset := nonidentical subset
closure := include limit of every point, complement is open; inverse images are closed, smallest closed subset containing
interior := union of all empty sets
compact := open cover has a finite subcover; for every sequence, a subsequence converges to a a point in A; closed and bounded by Heine–Borel
convergent sequence => all subsequences also converge to 0, cauchy
notation: \delta = boundary, - is closure, o is interior

trick for mutliple limits: use half epsilon instead

series
partial sums of a sequence; converges absolutely if sum |a_n| converges
Cauchy criterion: for each epsilon, exists number N so that for m, n > N, all |s_n - s_m| < epsilon
tools: squeeze theorem, comparison test, ratio test (|a_{n+1}/a_n| < 1), root test (nth root < 1), integral test (compare with rectangles)

continuous functions
continuous := for every sequence x in domain converging x_0, f(x) converges to f(x_0); 

epsilon-delta definition; to prove, show that within some radius of x_0, some relationship holds
continuity holds under absolute, scale, addition, multiplication, composition, max, min
continuous function on a closed interval is bounded and assumes max and min
IVT: for interval [a, b], exists some x in [a, b] such that f(x) = y for any y in [f(a), f(b)]
continuous function of an interval is also an interval; if strictly increasing, then f-1 is also a function; if f is one-to-one, it is either strict increasing or decreasing
uniform continuity is stricter, requires epsilon delta with every f(x) - f(x_0); continuous everywhere; continuous on closed interval implies uniform continuity; properties:
if s is cauchy, f(s) is cauchy
If uniformly continuous on (a, b), guess endpoints and make continuous on [a, b]
If f is continuous on some interval and the derivative is bounded, then f uni. Cont.
Proofs: pick random x, y and assume |x - y| < delta, reduce |f(x) - f(y)| to some function of delta
To determine radius of convergence, do root/ratio test


limits
lim_{x->aS} f(x) = L if for every sequence in S with limit a f(a_n) converges to L
two sided, left sided, right sided restrict S to varying intervals
limits can be added, multiplied, divided
Lipschitz := |f(x) - f(y)| <= M|x - y|
L’Hospital: can differentaitae
Trick - do a log transform before taking the limit


Metric continuity

Continuity in a metric space: epsilon delta under metric
Continuous mapping R->Rk is a path, requires each f continuous
For metric spaces (S, d) and (S*, d*), if E compact subset of S, then f(E) is compact subset of S* and f continuous
f(x) postive
Subset D on S is dense in S if every nonempty open set U intersects D
a subset E of S is nowhere dense in S if its closure E− has empty interior
E is nowhere dense in S if and only if S \ E− is dense in S
Compact subset E on S => f bounded on E and f assumes maximum and minimum
Baire Category Theorem: complete metric space (S, d) implies:
Union of sequence of dense open subsets is also dense open
If union contains non empty open set, so does one of the closed subsets
Union of sequence of nowhere dense subsets has dense complement
S is not a union of nowhere dense subsets
Second category: more than union of nowhere dense subsets
A closed set E in a metric space is said to be perfect if every point x in E is the limit of a sequence of points in E \ {x}
Trick for mappers - use trig functions
set E is disconnected if there are nonoverlapping nonempty open subsets; connectedness is preserved over continuous functions on metric spaces
Trick - can pick literally any open sets to split them
Path-connected if a continuous functions connects every two points => connected
Trick for uniform continuous - set alpha  > M/d and epsilon = 1, walk across range [x, y]
For connection proofs, show what must be contained in open subsets U_1 U_2 and point out that they are connected


Differentiation
F is differentiable at a if lim x-> a [f(x) - f(a)]/(x -a) exists and is finite.
Differentiability => continuous
Product rule:(fg)' = fg' + f'g
Chain rule: (g◦f) (a) = g’(f(a)) · f’(a)

Thm: if f defined on open interval with max value x_0, then f’(x_0) = 0 if differentiable
Rolle’s Thm: If f(a) = f(b) and f differentiable on (a, b) and continuous [a, b], then at least one c f’(c) = 0
MVT: for any f(a), f(b), at least one c has f’(c) = slope
Darboux’stheorem / IVT for derivatives: same idea if derivatives continuous
Derivative of inverse: for one-t-one on I, f^-1'(y_0) = 1/f'(x_0)

Integration

f is bounded on a closed interval with subset S
M = sup(f on S) m = inf(f on S)
Partition of [a, b] is an ordered subset with (a=t_0, t_1… t_n=b)
Upper darboux sum sums U(f, P) M on each t_i for sup on interval with partition
Upper darboux integral = inf(U(f, P) : P  is a partition)
F is integrable on [a, b] if L = U; this is Riemann integral
If P in Q, then L(f, P) <= L(f, Q) <= U(f, Q) <= U(F, P); U(f) <= L(f)
Alternatively, U(f) - L(f) < epsilon
Mesh of partition is largest subinterval length
Delta-epsilon on mesh and error
Riemann sums dont use end
Trick - use partition mesh bounds for solve d-e proofs

Every monotonic function on [a, b] integrable
Continuous function integrable
Its linear

If f(x) <= g(x) on [a, b] and both integrable, int <=
F can be split –

|int f(x)| < int|f|

Dominance conversion
Suppose sequence of functions that are monotonic, then lim int f = int lim f

Idea is to define factors that represent the bounds of integration
int_a^b g’ = g(a) - (b)

Integration by parts
Change of variable

Cauchy principal value

F-integratbility
Define increasing funtion f
 F-integrable on [a, b], provided LF (f) = UF (f);

Differentiability proofs - set up with either a to x or h to 0

Improper integrals
Combine with lhospitals to prove hard integrals, combine with FTC
To show that integral exists, show bounded above, or continuous positive decreasing
 Sequence of functions
converges uniformly: sequence of functions converges, uniformly Cauchy if all pairs
Trick - set arbitrary N after which all are within f(x) limiting function
Convergence at R implies continuoous

Taylors
f(x) =  sumk=0n-1f(k)(c) / k! (x-c)k
Let f be defined on (a, b) where a<c<b; here we allow a = −∞ or b = ∞. Suppose the nth derivative f(n) exists on (a, b). Then for each x = c in (a, b) there is some y between c and x such that
Rn(x) = f(y)(y)/n!*(x − c)n



Sin x = x + x^3/3! + sin(c) x^5 / 5!


Trick define function for distance; well defined bc exists, 

L = limsup()
